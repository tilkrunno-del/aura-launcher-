# AURA OS / AURA Launcher

**Human-first. Fast. Quiet.**

AURA OS is a next-generation mobile operating system concept, built to prioritize human focus, calmness, and efficiency — not endless notifications, ads, or attention loops.

AURA does not try to keep you on your screen.  
It helps you do what matters — and return to real life.
