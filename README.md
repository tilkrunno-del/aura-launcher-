# AURA OS / AURA Launcher

**Human-first. Fast. Quiet.**

AURA OS is a next-generation mobile operating system concept, built to prioritize human focus, calmness, and efficiency — not endless notifications, ads, or attention loops.

AURA does not try to keep you on your screen.  
It helps you do what matters — and return to real life.

## Philosophy

Modern operating systems are designed to maximize engagement.  
AURA OS is designed to minimize distraction.

Core principles:

- 🧠 Human-first design  
- ⚡ Fast and lightweight  
- 🔕 Quiet by default (no notification noise)  
- 🔐 Privacy-respecting

This project explores what a calm, respectful mobile OS could feel like.
